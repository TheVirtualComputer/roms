Program Name: flash.exe

Purpose: Program the Flash BIOS. Version 1.5

Syntax:

FLASH	[file=<filename>]
	[vl82c486]
	[vl82c480]
	[386sl]
	[486sl]
	[noboot]
	[counters]


Program Options:

[file=<filename>] Specifies a disk file that contains the BIOS image. The
	default name is "BIOS.BIN".
	
[vl82c486] Tells the program that the system board contains the VL82C486
	chip set. The VL82C486 is the chipset used on the Duck & Goose.
	This option is not normally used, if no chipset is specified,
	then the flash program will automatically determine which chipset
	is present.

[vl82c480] Tells the program that the system board contains the VL82C480
	chip set. The VL82C480 is the chipset used on the Martin.
	This option is not normally used, if no chipset is specified,
	then the flash program will automatically determine which chipset
	is present.

[386sl] Tells the program that the system board contains a 386SL processor.
	The 386SL is used on the X20. This option is not normally used,
	the flash program will automatically determine if a 386SL is
	present.

[486sl] Tells the program that the system board contains a 486SL processor.
	The 486SL is used on the X22. This option is not normally used,
	the flash program will automatically determine if a 486SL is
	present.

[noboot] Prevents the automatic reboot after programming the BIOS.

[counters] Enables the feature which displays the address of each byte that is
	being programmed. Default is no counters.




The BIOS file will be loaded into memory, then a warning message will be
displayed. The programming process should not be interrupted. If the
flash bios is left partially programmed, it will not work correctly.

There are three steps to the programming processed, first the flash is
filled with zeros, then it is erased (filled with FFs), and then the
BIOS program data is written. Progress through these steps will be
displayed on the screen.

The new BIOS may require different system initialization, or different
CMOS setting, than the BIOS it replaces. The system must be reset after
the flash is programmed. Normally, after the new BIOS is loaded, the flash
program will display some summary programming statistics, and then reset the
computer after five seconds. If the "noboot" option is active, then the
computer will not reboot. The program summary will be left on the display.
The program will not return to DOS, the user must manually reset the
computer to ensure proper initialization of the new BIOS.


The flash program, due to the need to directly program ROM memory space, 
does not comply with the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI).  This 
program requires that the processor is running in real-mode.  Multitasking 
programs (i.e. WINDOWS) and memory manipulative programs (i.e. EMM386.EXE) 
can not be active when the flash program is executed.  The flash program 
currently detects the state of the processor and terminates if the processor 
is in any state other than real-mode. 

To assure that you are in real-mode, make a system floppy disk that does not 
contain the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Boot the machine with the 
system disk in drive A.  This will assure that the machine is running in 
real-mode without modifying the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files that are 
on the hard-disk. 

If you have any questions on generation of a system floppy disk consult 
your DOS manual regarding the format or sys commands.
