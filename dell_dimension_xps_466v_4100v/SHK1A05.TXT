A05 bios revision for one of the Dell XPS 4xxV systems.

Be sure this is the right BIOS for your system. If your
system came from Dell with a DX4 processor installed, it
most definately isn't.

THIS BIOS WILL NOT WORK WITH THE PENTIUM PCI SYSTEM.

Version Notes
-------------

Version A05 ------------------- 

     Version A05 will fix the following;

     * Slow loading of DOS applications when a PS/2 mouse driver is installed.


Version A04 -------------------
 
	This version adds support for drives over 500MB. It does
	not include LBA! This means you get a maximum of 528MB
	useable space no matter how much bigger than 528MB
	your drive is.
