The MARTIN GREEN software has two components:
A new MARTIN BIOS (for DOS apps) and a Windows screensaver (for Windows).

The BIOS is flashed in as usual.  The EXTENDED BIOS FEATURES menu now has a
SCREEN SAVER option which can be set to {disabled, 10min, 30min, 1hr}.
This will cause the system to "go green"--shutting off the hard drive,
blanking the video screen, and slowing the CPU clock.  The CPU continues
to run at a slow rate, it does not stop.  This feature will not engage if
the processor is in protected mode.  Therefore, if you have EMM386 (or other
EMS memory manager) loaded the screen saver will not engage.  It is important to set the CMOS correctly
for the CPU speed and DRAM system memory timing.

The screensaver [WIN.SCR] should be copied into the \WINDOWS subdiectory.
BE SURE TO EDIT YOUR CONFIG.SYS and exclude the E000:0000-E000:03FFh 
memory range from the paging pool area of any memory managers.
Specifically, the EMM386 line must include the X=E000-E3FF parameter.
If this is not done, the machine will crash upon engaging the screensaver,
since the screensaver uses this memory area to communicate with Windows.
Run Windows, open the MAIN/CONTROLPANEL/DESKTOP/SCREENSAVER window.
Select the Screen Saver option and set the name to "ZEOS Screen Saver".
Set the DELAY to 1 minute, or click on the TEST button.  The screen should
go blank, and the hard drive should click off.  Moving the mouse or striking
a key on the keyboard should bring the system back.
